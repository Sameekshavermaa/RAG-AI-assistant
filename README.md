An AI-powered knowledge assistant that answers questions using **custom documents**.
Built using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** so responses are grounded in real context instead of hallucinating.

---

# 🚀 Demo

Ask questions about AI concepts like:

* What is Machine Learning?
* Difference between Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
* What are the applications of AI?

The assistant retrieves relevant context from documents and generates an answer.

# ✨ Features

✔ AI answers based on your documents
✔ Multi-file document retrieval
✔ Source file references
✔ Clean Streamlit interface
✔ Vector search using FAISS

# 🧠 How It Works

1️⃣ Documents are stored in the **data folder**

2️⃣ Text is converted into **embeddings using Sentence Transformers**

3️⃣ Embeddings are stored in **FAISS vector database**

4️⃣ When a user asks a question:

* The system retrieves relevant text chunks
* Sends them to the LLM
* Generates a grounded response

This technique is called **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.
